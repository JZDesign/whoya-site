        <section>
            <h2>The Short Version</h2>
            <p>WhoYa stores everything on your device. We don't have servers collecting your data. We don't track you. The only external service we use is RevenueCat to handle subscriptions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What Stays on Your Device (Everything)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Profiles</strong>: Names, avatars, progress</li>
                <li><strong>Phone numbers</strong>: The contacts you choose to practice</li>
                <li><strong>Photos</strong>: Any contact pictures you add</li>
                <li><strong>Game progress</strong>: Scores, streaks, achievements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of this lives in a file on your phone. We never see it. We can't access it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Permissions We Ask For</h2>
            <p><strong>Microphone</strong>: Some games let kids speak the phone number out loud. The audio is processed right on your device by iOS - we don't record it, store it, or send it anywhere.</p>
            <p><strong>Contacts</strong>: You can import phone numbers from your contacts. Your contact list never leaves your device. Not names, not numbers, not a count of contacts... nothing.</p>
            <p><strong>Photos</strong>: You can add pictures to contacts for visual learning. These are saved locally in the app.</p>
            <p><strong>Speech Recognition</strong>: iOS handles voice-to-text on your device. No audio goes to the cloud.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The One External Service: RevenueCat</h2>
            <p>We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. When you subscribe, RevenueCat handles the payment through Apple. They receive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your subscription status</li>
                <li>When it expires</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's it. They don't get your contacts, photos, or anything else from the app.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Analytics & Tracking</h2>
            <p>None. Zero. We don't use analytics tools. We don't track what you tap. We don't collect crash reports. We genuinely don't know how you use the app.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Deleting Your Data</h2>
            <p>Uninstall the app. That's it. Since everything is stored locally, deleting WhoYa deletes all your data. There's nothing on our servers to delete because we don't have servers storing your stuff.</p>
            <p>But... That also means there is no way to recover it later. There is no syncing between devices or anything.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p>I believe in your human right to privacy, and as a father of (currently 5) kids, I want them to have privacy too. WhoYa is designed for kids. That's exactly why we built it to be local-only. We don't collect data from children (or anyone).</p>
