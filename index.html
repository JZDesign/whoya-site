        <div class="container">
            <h2>The Problem No One Talks About</h2>
            <p>In the smartphone age, kids never see or dial actual phone numbers. Everything is "Hey Siri, call Mom" or tapping a contact photo. Speed dial means they never learn the actual digits.</p>
            <p>But what happens when your child needs to borrow a stranger's phone? Siri doesn't know who "Mom" is on someone else's phone. If your kid can't recite your number, they can't reach you.</p>
            <p>That's a problem worth solving.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- The Solution -->

            <p>Whoya turns phone number memorization into something kids actually want to do. Using proven memory techniques — spaced repetition, active recall, and multi-sensory learning — wrapped in fun games that kids don't even realize are educational.</p>
            <p>No nagging. No flash cards. No repeating your number at the dinner table for the hundredth time. Just a phone number learning game that actually works.</p>
