            <h2>What WhoYa Is</h2>
            <p>WhoYa is a game that helps kids memorize phone numbers. That's it. It's not an emergency service. It's not a replacement for a phone book. It's a fun way to practice and it uses some well established science to make it work better than repeatedly/passionately telling your kid to remember your number already.</p>
            <p>Side note... if you don't know what a phone book is... imagine a backpack full of paper, and on that paper was every person in your town's name, number, and (sometimes) address. People used to have jobs selling those... not that long ago.</p>

            <h2>Nothing in this world is free</h2>
            <p>In the app making business, money can be made several ways. Since we are privacy people, we won't sell your data, heck - we don't even collect it. That means we can reasonably make money with ads or with subscriptions.</p>
            <p>I hate ads... You?</p>
            <p>You get the point, this app requires a subscription. That unlocks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unlimited profiles</li>
                <li>Unlimited phone numbers</li>
                <li>All practice modes including voice challenges</li>
                <li>Well... the whole app</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Subscriptions are handled through the App Store. You can cancel anytime in your Apple account settings.</p>

            <h2>Your Responsibility</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You choose what phone numbers to add</li>
                <li>You supervise how children use the app</li>
                <li>You ensure imported contacts are appropriate</li>
                <li>You teach the kids to ask for help from appropriate people when they need it (so they can borrow a phone and call you)</li>
                <li>You raise respectable human beings (not my job... they're yours after all)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What We Promise</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Your kids will prefer having access to this over a rotary phone and a phone book</li>
                <li>We'll keep your data on your device where it belongs</li>
                <li>We won't suddenly start tracking you</li>
                <li>We'll keep working on the app</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What We Don't Promise</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>That kids will perfectly memorize every number in just a few short days (they're still learning!)</li>
                <li>That the app will work perfectly on every device until the heavens have been destroyed and rebuilt anew...</li>
                <li>That we'll never change anything</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>If we update these terms, we'll update the date at the top. For significant changes, I probably died and all bets are off. But, so that it's binding, we will have to alert you in the app.</p>
